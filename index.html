  <p>
  It's obvious that web design has evolved greatly and still continues to.
  The internet is no longer a world of flat dimension and basic imaging. Faulty GIF's and text-based
  pages are prehistoric!
  </p>
  <p>
  It's amazing how we've come from basic grid systems to flash players to web applications that
  open up in our mobile devices. Thanks to the seperation between content and design (CSS),
  web designers were now able to design pages with more creative freedom and smoother efficiency.
  </p>
  <p>
  Thanks to new units, flexbox, and web components, the web can now be designed with less
  frustrating coding processes and easier ways to build and re-use the building blocks
  that go into building web designs. Multi-dimensional graphics now replace the flat dimensions in the 90's. We've come a long way and the web still continues to
  become aesthetically and functionally advanced.
